## Test

We are using playwright for our tests.

# Rendering

You can run the tests locally through `yarn test:rendering`. Be aware that the baseline is from circleCi and does not match the snapshots taken locally. So to run them locally you need to run them twice so local baseline is created.

# Integration

You can run the tests locally through `yarn test:integration`.
